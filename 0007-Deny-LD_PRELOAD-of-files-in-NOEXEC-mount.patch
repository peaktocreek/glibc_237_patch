Subject: [PATCH 7/9] Deny LD_PRELOAD of files in NOEXEC mount

This commit hardens against a security bug in dl-load.c

Previously, one could dynamically load any shared object files even if
they resided on a NOEXEC mount partition. This introduces an exploit
where an attacker may load shared objects. These shared objects may
then usea ROP attack to conduct arbitrary execution, getting around
the NOEXEC requirement.

This fixes it by checking the file before reading if it lies in
a NOEXEC mount via an fstatvfs call.
